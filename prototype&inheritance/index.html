    <h1>JS Coding Assignment-Prototype and Inheritance</h1>

    <pre>
    <strong>Question1-Create 2 objects - parent and child. Attach methods to parent and use those methods in child object 
    using parents prototype</strong>

    let parent={
        greet : function(){
            console.log("Good Evening");
        }
    }
    let child=Object.create(parent);
    console.log(child);
    child.greet();

    explanation-
    code creates an object parent with a method greet, and an object child created using the Object.create method that inherits from parent.
    When console.log(child) is called, it will output an empty object, as child has no properties of its own. However, it inherits the greet 
    method from its prototype parent.
    When child.greet() is called, it will invoke the greet method from its prototype parent, which will log "Good Evening" to the console.
</pre>

    <strong>Question2-Write code to explain prototype chaining</strong>
    function print(num){
        return new Promise((resolve)=>{
            setTimeout(()=>{
                 console.log(num);
                 resolve()
             },1000)
         })
      }
      print(1) 
      .then(()=>print(2))
      .then(()=>print(3))
      .then(()=>print(4))
      .then(()=>print(5))
      .then(()=>print(6))
      .then(()=>print(7))

    explanation-
    here multiple .then methods are used which indicates prototype chaining. The code calls print(1) and 
    chains a series of then() methods that each call print() with a new number once the previous Promise resolves.
    This creates a sequence of delayed console logs that will execute in order.
</pre>

<pre>
    <strong>Question3-Add a method to calculate sum of all elements in Array in array's protype, use that method to calculate 
    sum for multiple arrays</strong>

    Array.prototype.sum = function() {
    return this.reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr, 0);
    };

    let arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
    let arr2 = [4, 5, 6];
    let arr3 = [7, 8, 9];


    let sum1 = arr1.sum();
    let sum2 = arr2.sum();
    let sum3 = arr3.sum();


    console.log(sum1); 
    console.log(sum2); 
    console.log(sum3); 

    explanation-
    here we are creating array prototype with sum method. Then creating arrays for calculation. then calculating sum for each array using that 
    sum method and printing the results.
</pre>

<pre>
    <strong>Question4-Write a JavaScript function to retrieve all the names of object's own and inherited properties.</strong>
    function retrieveAll(){
        const obj = {
          a: 1,
          b: 2,
          c: 3
        };
        console.log(Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj));
        let proto=Object.getPrototypeOf(obj);
        console.log(proto);
        }
        retrieveAll()
    explanation-
    This function retrieveAll() creates an object object1 with three properties a, b, and c. It then uses the Object.getOwnPropertyNames() 
    method to retrieve an array of property names for the object1 object and logs it to the console.
    Next, it retrieves the prototype of the object1 object using Object.getPrototypeOf() and logs it to the console.
