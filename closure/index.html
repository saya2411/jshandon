        question1-
        <pre>
        function counter(){
        var counter = 0;
    
        function IncreaseCounter() {
            return counter += 1;
        };
    
        return IncreaseCounter;
        }
    
        var counter = counter();
        alert(counter());
        alert(counter());
        alert(counter());
        alert(counter());</pre></h2>
    
        <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;output:
            1
            2
            3
            4
        
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because when the function counter is invoked, the control will first assign counter value as 0,then the flow encounters another (inside) function named <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;IncreaseCounter here the control will return the counter value which is increemented by 1. Then flow of control will come out of the function and<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;calls the counter() 4 times, resuting the above output.
    </pre>

    <h2> question2-
        <pre>
        let count = 0;
        (function () {
            if (count === 0) {
                let count = 1;
                console.log(count); // What is logged?
            }
        console.log(count); // What is logged?
        })();
        </pre>
    </h2>

    
        <pre>
            Output is-
            1
            0
        
        because when control assigns the 0 to count variable(global variable), function() will be invoked which is an IIFE(Immediately Invoked Function Execution), 
        so first control will check whether count value is equal to 0 or not, here it is true, so it will go inside the if block, there count is reassingned 
        so the reassingned value of count will be considered and the control will print the reassigned value that is 1. Now the control will come out of the 
        if block, then again there is a print statement,so this stmt will print count value as 0, since count is 0(from global scope)
    </pre>

    <h2>question3-
        <pre>
            for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
                setTimeout(function log() {
                  console.log(i); // What is logged?
                }, 1000);
              }
        </pre>
    </h2>

    
            <pre>           Output is- 
                    3
                    3
                    3 
        
        because when the control runs the for loop with var keyword, for all the 3 iteration, it will print 3(3 times) after 1000ms that is 1s, 
        because setTimeout funtion prints the result after the specified time (delay).
    </pre>

    <h2>question4-<pre>
        Write a code to calculate area of a rectangle using inner function. In this case outer function should accept 
        parameter length and inner function should accept parameter breadth.</h2></pre>
   
        <pre>
            function length(length) {
                function breadth(breadth) {
                  return length * breadth;
                }
                return breadth;
              }

              const areaOfRectangle = length(20);
              console.log("Area of Rectangle is: "+areaOfRectangle(10));
        
            output--
            Area of Rectangle is: 200
        <br>
            here length() is having a length as a parameter(outer function), which returns breadth as a result of inner function breadth having breadth as a parameter,
            multiples length and breadth. So, when length function is called with 20 as an argument, the value gets stored in the areaOfRectangle varible, which then 
            passess 10 as an argument, which is taken by the inside function breadth, which then multiples length and breadth, resulting breadth to the outer function
            which then prints the value 200 as the areaOfRectangle.
        </pre>
    <h2>question5-
        Take a variable in outer function and create an inner function to increase the counter every time it is called</h2>
    <pre>
        function outer(){
            let counter = 0;
        
            function inner() {
                return counter += 1;
            };
        
            return inner;
        }
        
        let counter =outer();
        console.log(counter());
        console.log(counter());
        console.log(counter());
        console.log(counter());
    </pre>
    <p>Output is-
        <pre>
            1
            2
            3
            4
        
        because when the function outer is invoked, the control will first assign counter value as 0,then the flow encounters another (inside) function named inner here 
        the control will return the counter value which is increemented by 1. Then flow of control will come out of the function and calls the counter() 4 times, resuting
        the above output.
    </pre>

    <h2>question6- 
        Print Output
        <pre>            var a = 12;
            (function () {
              alert(a);
            })();
        </pre>
    </h2><pre>
    Output is--
        12
        because when this anonymous function is called, the value of a is printed as 12, which is declared outside the function.
    </pre>

    <h2>question7- 
        Print the output
        <pre>
        var a = 10;
        var x = (function () {
          var a = 12;
          return function () {
            alert(a);
          };
        })();
        x();
        </pre>
    </h2>
    <pre>       Output is--
        12
        because when this anonymous function is called, the value of a is printed as 12, which is declared inside the function. To anonymous function which is assigned to 
        var x.
    </pre>

    <h2>question8-
        Print the output--
        <pre>
            var globalVar = "xyz";

            (function outerFunc(outerArg) {
                var outerVar = 'a';
                
                (function innerFunc(innerArg) {
                var innerVar = 'b';
                
                console.log(
                    "outerArg = " + outerArg + "\n" +
                    "innerArg = " + innerArg + "\n" +
                    "outerVar = " + outerVar + "\n" +
                    "innerVar = " + innerVar + "\n" +
                    "globalVar = " + globalVar);
                
                })(456);
            })(123);
        </pre>
    </h2>

    <pre>            Output is-
        
            outerArg = 123
            innerArg = 456
            outerVar = a
            innerVar = b
            globalVar = xyz
        
        because, here the outer function is outerFunc with the argument as 123, then innerFunc is passed with an argument 456, then outerVar is assigned to 'a' 
        in the outer function, then innerVar is assigned to 'b' in inner function, then the global variable is globalVar as "xyz" declared before the function.
